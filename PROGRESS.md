# code-srs — Progress Log

A running log of what we build and change, newest first. Each entry notes the
milestone, what changed, and the commit it maps to. See [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md)
for the architecture and [mockup.html](./mockup.html) for the visual reference.

## How we work
- Changes are grouped into **milestones** (M0–M8, see DESIGN.md §10).
- After each logical change, a **commit checkpoint** is called out with a ready
  commit message. Format: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `test:`).
- Nothing is committed automatically — the message is provided for you to run.

---

## Decisions added after initial design
- **Flip-to-reveal animation** for self-graded cards (Basic, Code Reading, Bug
  Finding): tapping the card rotates it to show the answer, then the grade bar
  appears. Tall code snippets use a smooth slide/expand reveal instead of a 3D
  flip (flip is awkward for long content on mobile). Finalize per-type in M3.

## Log

### 2026-06-27 — M8 cloud backend (Supabase) — checkpoint 2: repository + auth
- **feat:** `SupabaseRepository` implements the same `Repository` interface as Dexie.
  Each table stores the full entity in a `data` jsonb column; generated columns
  (`due`, `suspended`, `card_id`, `reviewed_at`) back the hot queries; text/tag/type
  filtering stays in memory, identical to Dexie, so both backends return the same results.
- **feat:** `getRepository()` auto-selects Supabase when `VITE_SUPABASE_*` env is present,
  else falls back to local Dexie (dev works with no setup).
- **feat (auth):** single-user magic-link sign-in — `AuthProvider` (session tracking),
  `LoginPage` (signInWithOtp), `AuthGate` (gates the app only when Supabase is configured).
  Sign-out + signed-in email added to Settings.
- Build + lint + 58 tests pass. Main bundle ~795kB (gz 236kB); supabase-js added ~200kB raw.

### 2026-06-27 — M8 cloud backend (Supabase) — checkpoint 1: scaffolding
- Decision: move off browser-only IndexedDB to a real DB. Chose **Supabase** (Postgres,
  free tier, built-in auth, no backend server) — online-first now, offline sync deferred.
  Repository pattern makes it a contained swap.
- **chore:** installed `@supabase/supabase-js`; added `supabase/schema.sql` (one table per
  entity, jsonb `data` + generated columns + RLS), lazily-created client gated on env,
  `.env.local.example`. No behavior change until env is set.

### 2026-06-24 — Preview read-only fix + drag-and-drop ordering
- **fix:** In Preview the interactive controls looked clickable but were dead (no-op
  setResponse). Added `readOnly?` to `QuestionProps` + `CardView`; interactive renderers
  honor it: ordering hides drag/arrows, matching disables selects, mcq disables options
  (no hover), codeCompletion shows "flip to reveal" instead of an editor. Preview passes
  `readOnly`.
- **feat (UX):** Ordering study UI now uses **drag-and-drop** (installed `@dnd-kit/core`
  + `/sortable` + `/utilities`) instead of up/down arrows — drag rows (grip affordance),
  touch + keyboard accessible. Reveal/preview render a static marked list. Editor
  (authoring the correct order) keeps arrows. Main bundle +~24kB gz. autoGrade unchanged.
- Build + lint + 58 tests pass.

### 2026-06-24 — Nested decks (deck tree) — checkpoint 1: Dashboard tree
- Design approved: arbitrary-depth grouping via the existing `Deck.parentId` (one entity,
  no separate Section). Any node can hold cards and/or subdecks. Defaults: deleting a
  non-empty node is blocked; reparenting deferred.
- `domain/decks/tree.ts` (pure): `buildDeckTree` (forest from parentId; missing/self parent
  → root; cycle-safe), `descendantIds`, `flattenDeckTree` (display order + full path). 5 tests.
- `DashboardPage`: renders the deck tree — collapse/expand, indentation, **subtree-rolled-up**
  card/due counts per node, and per-node actions: New subdeck (parentId), rename, delete
  (blocked if it has subdecks or own cards). Top-level "New deck" creates a root.
- Build + lint + 51 tests pass.
- Remaining for this feature: (2) editor deck picker showing the full path; (3) "Study a
  subtree" (review a node + all descendants, with the review route accepting a deck).
  Also TODO: extend the AI import prompt to allow deck `parentId` for hierarchy-on-import.

### 2026-06-24 — Nested decks — checkpoint 2: path-aware deck picker
- `CardEditorPage` deck `<select>` now lists decks via `flattenDeckTree(buildDeckTree(...))`,
  labeling each option with its full path (e.g. "OS / Processes / Threads") in tree order.
  New-card default deck also uses tree order. Build + lint + 51 tests pass.
- Remaining: (3) Study a subtree.

### 2026-06-24 — Nested decks — checkpoint 3: study a subtree (feature complete)
- `domain/decks/tree.ts`: added `subtreeIds(decks, rootId)` (flat, cycle-safe) + 2 tests.
- `ReviewPage`: reads `?deck=<id>`; when present, studies that deck + all descendants
  (filters due cards to the subtree id set) and shows a "Studying X and its subdecks ·
  all decks" header. Session key includes the deck so switching scope resets it.
- Dashboard: each node with due cards gets a ▶ Study link → `/review?deck=<id>`.
- Build + lint + 53 tests pass. ✅ **Nested decks feature complete** (tree UI + path picker +
  subtree study).
- Still TODO (small): extend the AI import prompt to document deck `parentId` so generated
  files can build a hierarchy on import. (DONE 2026-06-24 — prompt updated with nesting.)

### 2026-06-24 — Preview mode (browse a deck without scheduling)
- `features/cards/correctResponse.ts`: maps a card to its "fully correct" response so
  interactive types reveal their answer in preview (mcq→correct ids, ordering→canonical
  order, matching→identity map, codeCompletion→first solution, self-graded→undefined). 5 tests.
- `features/preview/PreviewPage.tsx` at route `/preview?deck=<id>`: browse a deck + its
  subdecks' cards one by one (sorted by createdAt), flip/reveal to see the answer, Prev/Next.
  Read-only — NO grading, NO review logs, NO scheduler impact (uses CardView + FlipCard with
  a no-op setResponse; reveal sets response to the correct answer). Keyboard: ←/→ navigate,
  Space flips. Empty state.
- Dashboard: each node with cards gets a 📖 "Browse cards" link → `/preview?deck=<id>`
  (alongside the ▶ Study link).
- Build + lint + 58 tests pass.

### 2026-06-24 — Fixes during dogfooding
- **fix:** Editor crashed whenever the active card `type` and `content` rendered out of
  sync — `Cannot read properties of undefined`. Two reports: (1) changing a new card's type
  to MCQ; (2) opening a Code Completion card from Browse to edit. Root cause (both): `def`
  was derived from a synchronously-updated type while `content` was set in a `useEffect`
  (runs after render), so for one render a type's `isComplete`/Editor saw the wrong content
  shape. **Robust fix:** unified `type` + `content` into a single atomic `editor` state
  ({type, content}) that always updates together — new cards seed it immediately, edit cards
  hydrate once loaded (null → Loading until then). Added a "Card not found" guard. This
  removes the entire mismatch class. Build + lint + 46 tests pass.
  - Follow-up worth doing: this is exactly what a component render test (deferred jsdom
    suite) would catch — note when picking up the component-tests queue item.

### 2026-06-23 — M0: project scaffold
- Vite 8 + React 19 + TypeScript 6 project initialized (template `react-ts`).
- Linting via `oxlint` (Vite's current default, replaces ESLint).
- Merged scaffold into repo root; kept DESIGN.md / PROGRESS.md / mockup.html / README.md.
- Renamed package to `code-srs`. `npm run build` passes (tsc + vite build clean).
- **Still in M0:** Tailwind + shadcn/ui setup, folder structure, router, PWA, deploy.

### 2026-06-23 — M0: Tailwind v4 + theme system
- Installed `tailwindcss` + `@tailwindcss/vite` (v4); added plugin to vite.config.ts.
- Added `@` → `src` path alias (vite + tsconfig).
- Ported mockup palette into runtime CSS variables in `index.css`; mapped to
  Tailwind tokens via `@theme inline` so utilities (`bg-panel`, `text-muted`,
  `border-border`, …) swap live when `[data-theme]` flips.
- Dark mode via `[data-theme="dark"]` on `<html>` (default dark), not media query.
- Replaced stock starter `App.tsx`/`App.css`/demo assets with a themed placeholder
  that toggles dark/light to prove the system. Build passes.
- **Still in M0:** shadcn-style primitives, folder structure, router + AppShell, PWA, deploy.

### 2026-06-23 — M0: folder structure + Router + AppShell
- Installed `react-router-dom`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `lucide-react`.
- Created the DESIGN.md §8 skeleton: `app/`, `components/{layout,ui,code,markdown}/`,
  `features/{dashboard,review,cards,drafts,stats,settings,decks}/`,
  `domain/{scheduling,grading,search,io}/`, `data/`, `hooks/`, `lib/` (.gitkeep for empties).
- `lib/cn.ts` (clsx + tailwind-merge); `app/theme.tsx` (ThemeProvider + useTheme,
  persists to localStorage, default dark); `app/providers.tsx` (QueryClient added in M1).
- AppShell: desktop sidebar + mobile bottom-nav + sticky topbar (title/sub from a
  shared `navItems` config) + theme toggle + "Study now". Matches the mockup layout.
- React Router with 6 routes (Dashboard/Review/Browse/Drafts/Stats/Settings), each a
  `PagePlaceholder` stub noting its target milestone.
- No-flash inline theme script in index.html; removed stock `App.tsx`.
- Build passes; oxlint clean. **M0 remaining:** PWA + first deploy.

### 2026-06-23 — M0: PWA setup (M0 complete; deploy deferred)
- Installed `vite-plugin-pwa`; configured manifest (name, theme/bg `#0b0e14`,
  standalone, `icon.svg`) with `registerType: autoUpdate`, `injectRegister: auto`.
- Added `public/icon.svg` brand mark; ignored `dev-dist/`.
- Build emits `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, Workbox precache (6 entries) →
  app is installable + offline-capable.
- **Deployment deferred** by choice — will set up (provider TBD) when going live.
- ✅ **M0 done.** Next: M1 (data seam + Basic card).

### 2026-06-23 — M1: domain types + Repository interface
- Added `lib/id.ts` (`newId()` via crypto.randomUUID).
- Domain entity types in **`src/types/`** (common, card, deck, draft, review) with a
  barrel `index.ts`. **Deviation from DESIGN §8:** entities live in a shared
  `src/types/` rather than `features/cards/types/`, because Card/Deck/Draft/ReviewLog
  are tightly coupled (Card embeds SchedulingState; Repository touches all) and a
  shared location avoids cross-feature import cycles. DESIGN updated to match.
- `Card` is the discriminated union from DESIGN §3; added `CardOfType<T>` helper.
- `data/repository.ts`: the storage seam — `CrudRepo<T>` (incl. `bulkPut` for import),
  `CardRepo` (`getDue`, `search`), `ReviewRepo`, and the `Repository` aggregate.
- Build + oxlint clean. Next: DexieRepository (IndexedDB implementation).

### 2026-06-23 — M1: DexieRepository (IndexedDB)
- Installed `dexie`.
- `data/dexie/db.ts`: `AppDB` (v1) with tables cards/decks/drafts/reviewLogs.
  Indexes: cards `id, deckId, type, *tags, scheduling.due`; decks `id, parentId, name`;
  drafts `id, createdAt`; reviewLogs `id, cardId, reviewedAt`. Booleans not indexed
  (IndexedDB keys can't be boolean) — `suspended` filtered in memory.
- `domain/search/searchableText.ts`: exhaustive switch flattening each card type's
  content to a search string (compile error forces handling new types).
- `data/dexie/DexieRepository.ts`: implements the `Repository` seam. Generic `crud()`
  helper (`getAll/getById/put/bulkPut/delete`); `getDue` (index by due date + in-memory
  filters, sorted by due); `search` (in-memory filter, sorted by updatedAt); review log
  append/forCard/range.
- `data/index.ts`: `getRepository()` factory (the one place that picks the backend).
- Build + oxlint clean. Note: no automated tests yet — Vitest + fake-indexeddb is a
  small dedicated step to schedule. Next: TanStack Query layer + Basic card UI.

### 2026-06-23 — M1: test setup + DexieRepository coverage
- Installed `vitest` + `fake-indexeddb`; added `vitest.config.ts` (node env, `@` alias,
  setup file importing `fake-indexeddb/auto`) and `test` / `test:watch` scripts.
- Excluded `*.test.ts(x)` and `src/test` from the app tsconfig so the prod build skips them.
- `domain/scheduling/state.ts`: `initialSchedulingState(now)` — neutral "new" seed (M2
  wires ts-fsrs to evolve it).
- `DexieRepository.test.ts`: 9 tests covering CRUD/upsert/delete/bulkPut, getDue
  (due/new vs future vs suspended, deck filter, limit, sort), search (text, suspended,
  type, tag), and reviews (append, forCard ordering, range). All green.
- Build + lint + tests pass. Next: TanStack Query layer + Basic card UI.

### 2026-06-23 — M1: TanStack Query layer
- Installed `@tanstack/react-query`; `app/queryClient.ts` (staleTime 30s, no retry, no
  refetch-on-focus — local data only changes via our mutations); wired
  `QueryClientProvider` into `providers.tsx`.
- `domain/cards/factory.ts`: `createCard(input)` fills the envelope (id, timestamps,
  suspended, initial scheduling). `NewCardInput` uses a **distributive Omit** so the
  discriminated `type`<->`content` correlation survives.
- `hooks/queryKeys.ts`: centralized keys for consistent invalidation.
- `hooks/useDecks.ts` (useDecks, useCreateDeck, useSaveDeck, useDeleteDeck) and
  `hooks/useCards.ts` (useCard, useDueCards, useSearchCards, useCreateCard, useSaveCard,
  useDeleteCard) wrapping `getRepository()`; mutations invalidate affected keys.
- Build + lint clean. Next: Basic card UI (create/edit + list) — closes the
  UI -> Query -> repo -> IndexedDB loop end-to-end.

### 2026-06-23 — M1: Basic card end-to-end (M1 complete)
- `components/ui/Button.tsx` (primary/secondary/ghost variants).
- `features/cards/cardTypeMeta.ts`: per-type label + badge color + `getCardTitle()`
  (exhaustive). `CardTypeBadge.tsx` renders the colored badge.
- `features/cards/CardEditorPage.tsx`: Basic Q&A editor (front/back/tags). Create via
  `useCreateCard`; edit via `useSaveCard`; auto-creates an "Inbox" deck on first card
  (proper deck mgmt in M4). Non-Basic edit shows an M3 notice. Type picker + per-type
  editor registry deferred to M3.
- `features/cards/BrowsePage.tsx`: real list from IndexedDB via `useSearchCards`, with
  badges, tags, empty state, and links to new/edit.
- Routes added: `/cards/new`, `/cards/:id/edit`.
- Build + lint + 9 tests pass. **Verified loop:** create card -> persists to IndexedDB
  -> shows in Browse -> survives reload.
- ✅ **M1 done.** Next: M2 (review engine — FSRS + review session).

### 2026-06-23 — M2: FSRS scheduler module
- Installed `ts-fsrs` (v5.4.1).
- Added `learningSteps` to `SchedulingState` (persisted so FSRS short-term learning
  steps survive across sessions; DESIGN §3 updated). `initialSchedulingState` seeds 0.
- `domain/scheduling/scheduler.ts`: pure wrapper mapping our camelCase/Millis/string-state
  <-> ts-fsrs Card (Date/snake_case/State enum). `reviewState(state, rating, now)`,
  `previewStates(state, now)` (per-grade next states for button labels), and
  `buildReviewLog({before, after, ...})` with exact deltas.
- `domain/scheduling/format.ts`: `formatInterval` (<1m / 10m / 2h / 5d / mo / y).
- `scheduler.test.ts`: 5 tests (Good advances reps/due, Again < Easy, preview monotonic,
  log deltas, interval formatting). Total suite: 14 tests, all green.
- Build + lint clean. Next: review session (state machine + GradeBar + wiring).

### 2026-06-23 — M2: review session (M2 complete)
- Added `ReviewRepo.delete(id)` (interface + Dexie) for undo; +1 repo test (now 15 total).
- `hooks/useReview.ts`: `useGradeCard` (compute next scheduling, persist card + append
  log) and `useUndoGrade` (restore original card + delete log).
- `features/review/useReviewSession.ts`: state machine over a snapshotted due-card queue
  (Presenting -> Answered -> Scheduled -> next) with a one-step undo stack and per-card
  timing for ReviewLog.durationMs.
- `features/review/GradeBar.tsx`: Again/Hard/Good/Easy with per-grade interval labels
  from `previewStates` + `formatInterval`.
- `features/review/ReviewSession.tsx`: reveal flow, progress bar, undo, completion screen,
  keyboard shortcuts (Space/Enter reveal; 1-4 grade; U undo). Basic cards render fully;
  other types get a self-graded fallback until M3.
- `features/review/ReviewPage.tsx`: wired to `useDueCards`, with loading / nothing-due states.
- Build + lint + 15 tests pass. **Verified path:** create Basic cards -> Review -> grade ->
  due date advances (card leaves the queue). ✅ **M2 done.** Next: M3 (all card types via
  the renderer registry + flip-to-reveal).

### 2026-06-23 — M3 (a): card renderer registry + Basic on it
- `components/ui/Field.tsx`: shared `Field` wrapper + `fieldClass` for all editors.
- `features/cards/registry/types.ts`: `CardTypeDefinition<T>` (type, interactive,
  emptyContent, isComplete, Question/Answer/Editor components, optional autoGrade) and
  `QuestionProps`/`AnswerProps`/`EditorProps`/`CardResponse`.
- `features/cards/renderers/basic/`: Question, Answer, Editor + `basicDefinition`.
- `features/cards/registry/index.ts`: registry map (Partial during M3 — TODO: tighten to
  full Record for compile-time exhaustiveness at M3 end) + `getCardDefinition` (single
  widening cast; callers stay type-safe) + `isTypeImplemented`.
- `features/cards/CardView.tsx`: dispatcher rendering Question + revealed Answer.
- Refactored `ReviewSession` (uses CardView; threads per-card `response` state) and
  `CardEditorPage` (renders `def.Editor`; page owns deck/tags/type). Removed inline Basic.
- Build + lint + 15 tests pass; Basic behavior unchanged. Next M3 (b): CodeMirror + Code
  Reading / Bug Finding.

### 2026-06-23 — M3 (b): CodeMirror + Code Reading & Bug Finding
- Installed CodeMirror 6 (state/view/language + lang-cpp/python/javascript/rust +
  theme-one-dark). Curated language set (C/C++, Python, JS, TS, Rust, plaintext).
- `components/code/CodeView.tsx`: read-only highlighted display; transparent over
  `--code-bg`; highlight style follows app theme (oneDark vs default).
- `components/code/LazyCodeView.tsx`: React.lazy wrapper so CodeMirror loads on demand.
- Split language module: `languageList.ts` (labels only, for editor select) vs
  `languageExtensions.ts` (grammars, used only by CodeView). This keeps grammars out of
  the main bundle: initial JS dropped from ~1084kB to ~497kB (157kB gz); CodeMirror is a
  ~588kB chunk fetched lazily. (Lazy chunk triggers the >500kB warning — acceptable.)
- `components/code/CodeBlockField.tsx`: language picker + mono textarea for editors.
- Renderers: `codeReading` (code + question -> answer) and `bugFinding` (prompt + code +
  optional progressive hint -> explanation). Both self-graded; registered.
- Added a **card-type picker** to the New Card editor (implemented types only), so the new
  types are creatable.
- Build + lint + 15 tests pass. Next M3 (c): MCQ (first auto-graded type).

### 2026-06-23 — M3 (c): MCQ + auto-grade flow
- Added optional `isResponseReady(response)` to `CardTypeDefinition` (gates the Check
  button for interactive types).
- `renderers/mcq/`: Question (radio/checkbox select; shows correct/incorrect on reveal
  with Check/X markers), Answer (explanation), Editor (prompt, multiple-answer toggle,
  add/remove options with correct markers, explanation). `mcqDefinition` is interactive
  with `autoGrade` (exact-set match) + `isResponseReady` (>=1 selected). Registered.
- **Auto-grade flow in ReviewSession:** interactive cards show "Check answer" (disabled
  until a response is ready); on reveal, `autoGrade` runs, a Correct/Incorrect banner
  shows, and `GradeBar` pre-marks the suggested grade (Good if correct, else Again) with
  a ✓ + ring. User can override any grade; ReviewLog.autoGraded = (chosen === suggested).
  Self-graded types keep "Show answer" with no suggestion.
- `mcq.test.ts`: 5 tests (single/multiple/empty autoGrade, isResponseReady, isComplete).
  Suite now 20 tests, all green. Build + lint clean.
- Next M3 (d): Ordering + Matching (interactive, auto-graded).

### 2026-06-23 — M3 (d): Ordering + Matching
- `lib/shuffle.ts` (Fisher–Yates). Extended `isResponseReady` signature to also receive
  `content` (Matching needs to know all lefts are assigned); existing MCQ fn still valid
  (fewer params). ReviewSession passes `current.content`.
- `renderers/ordering/`: items stored in correct order, presented shuffled (stable per
  card); reorder via up/down controls; reveal marks each position green/red; Answer shows
  the canonical order. autoGrade = exact order match. Editor reorders with up/down.
- `renderers/matching/`: left items fixed, right options shuffled in a per-row select;
  reveal marks rows; Answer lists correct pairs. autoGrade = every left maps to its own
  pair; isResponseReady requires all assigned. Editor manages left↔right pairs.
- Registered both. Tests: ordering (5) + matching (added) → suite now 27, all green.
- Build + lint clean. 6/7 types done. Next M3 (e): Code Completion (editable CodeMirror
  + normalized-match auto-grade), then (f) flip-to-reveal.

### 2026-06-23 — M3 (e): Code Completion + full registry
- Installed `@codemirror/commands`. `components/code/CodeEditor.tsx` (editable CM:
  history, defaultKeymap + indentWithTab; uncontrolled after mount, remount via key) +
  `LazyCodeEditor.tsx`.
- `domain/grading/normalize.ts`: `normalizeCode` (whitespace/case opts) + `matchesAnySolution`.
- `renderers/codeCompletion/`: Question shows read-only scaffold + editable answer (becomes
  read-only CodeView on reveal); Answer shows solution(s) + explanation; Editor has scaffold,
  multiple accepted solutions, validation mode (normalizedMatch | none) + whitespace/case
  toggles, explanation. autoGrade returns null when mode=none (self-graded). 6 tests.
- **Registry now a full `Record<CardType, …>`** — compile-time exhaustiveness; all 7 types
  registered. Removed `isTypeImplemented`; `getCardDefinition` is total. Simplified CardView
  (no fallback) and CardEditorPage (no unsupported branch; type picker lists all types).
- Build + lint + 33 tests pass. CodeEditor is its own lazy 24kB chunk. ✅ all 7 types done.
- Next M3 (f): flip-to-reveal animation, then M3 wrap-up.

### 2026-06-23 — M3 (f): reveal animations (M3 complete)
- Added `reveal?: 'flip' | 'slide'` to `CardTypeDefinition`; `basic` uses `flip`, all others
  default to `slide`.
- `components/ui/FlipCard.tsx` + CSS in index.css: JS-free 3D flip via grid overlap (both
  faces share a cell, container sizes to the taller face — no height measuring). `prefers-
  reduced-motion` disables transitions.
- Slide/fade `reveal-in` keyframe applied to the answer block (CardView) and the slide-mode
  banner/GradeBar.
- ReviewSession branches: flip cards show Question (front, tap/Space to reveal) → Answer +
  GradeBar (back); slide cards keep the stacked reveal. Code-heavy + interactive cards stay
  on slide (flip is janky for tall content), per the design note.
- Build + lint + 33 tests pass. ✅ **M3 complete** — all 7 card types, auto-grade flow, and
  reveal animations done. Next: M4 (decks, tags, search, browse polish + card delete).

### 2026-06-23 — M4 (a): Browse search, filters, suspend, delete
- Rebuilt `BrowsePage`: text search (deferred via useDeferredValue), type filter chips,
  tag filter chips (tag universe derived from an all-cards query), and a "show suspended"
  toggle. Filtered list uses `repo.search` via `useSearchCards`.
- Row actions: suspend/unsuspend (via `useSaveCard`, toggles `suspended`) and delete (via
  `useDeleteCard`, window.confirm — can swap for a nicer dialog later). Suspended cards show
  dimmed with a badge; excluded from the review queue.
- Counts ("X of N shown"), empty state, and no-match state.
- Build + lint + 33 tests pass. Next M4 (b): deck management + deck selector in editor.

### 2026-06-23 — M4 (b): deck management + deck selector (M4 complete)
- Real `DashboardPage`: 3 stat cards (due today, total cards, decks), "Study N due" CTA,
  and a Decks section. Per-deck total/due counts derived client-side from all-cards +
  due-cards queries. Create (prompt), rename (prompt), delete (blocked if deck non-empty,
  else confirm). Empty state.
- `CardEditorPage`: added a Deck `<select>` (new + edit, so cards can be moved between
  decks); defaults a new card to the first deck; keeps the auto-"Inbox" fallback when no
  decks exist.
- Build + lint + 33 tests pass. ✅ **M4 complete** (search/filters/suspend/delete + deck
  management). Next: M5 (draft inbox / quick capture).

### 2026-06-23 — M5: draft inbox (M5 complete)
- `hooks/useDrafts.ts`: useDrafts (newest-first), useDraft(id), useCreateDraft,
  useDeleteDraft (over the `drafts` repo). Added drafts query keys.
- `features/drafts/seedContent.ts`: maps a draft's free text into the primary field of the
  chosen type (front/prompt/question/explanation).
- `DraftsPage`: quick-capture box (textarea + optional intended-type select; ⌘/Ctrl+Enter)
  and the inbox list (relative time, type badge, Make-card, delete). Empty state.
- Convert-to-card: "Make card" → `/cards/new?draft=<id>`; editor reads the draft, seeds
  type/deck/content, and on save creates the card **and deletes the draft**, returning to
  /drafts.
- Build + lint + 33 tests pass. ✅ **M5 complete**. Next: M6 (import/export JSON + PWA
  offline polish).

### 2026-06-23 — M6: import/export (M6 complete)
- Extended the seam: `CrudRepo.clear()`, `ReviewRepo.bulkPut/all/clear` (+ Dexie impls).
- `domain/io/backup.ts`: versioned envelope (`{app,version,exportedAt,data}`), `buildBackup`,
  `serializeBackup`, `parseBackup` (validates app/version/data — friendly errors). 5 tests.
- `data/backup.ts`: `exportBackup()` (gathers all entities) and `importBackup(backup, mode)`
  (merge = upsert; replace = clear then bulkPut). `lib/download.ts` for file download.
- `hooks/useBackup.ts`: `useImportBackup` (invalidates all queries after a bulk write).
- `SettingsPage`: real Appearance (theme), Scheduler note, and Data section — Export JSON
  (downloads `code-srs-backup-<date>.json`), Import JSON with merge/replace (replace confirms),
  status feedback. Round-trip integration test (export→clear→import, merge upsert). 40 tests.
- PWA offline was set up in M0 (Workbox precache); verify via `npm run preview` offline.
- Build + lint + 40 tests pass. ✅ **M6 complete**. Next: M7 (stats + dark-mode/a11y polish).

### 2026-06-23 — M7: stats + polish (M7 complete)
- `domain/stats/computeStats.ts` (pure): from review logs + cards → totalReviews,
  reviewsLast30, reviewsPerDay (14, oldest-first), retention (mature review/relearning,
